You need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. If not, please download and install it from ``www.nodejs.org``

1. Please clone the repo or download the whole directory.
2. Install dependencies by running
````bash
$ npm install
````
3. All the test scenarios are in the test suite in directory ``test/index.js``. You can run it by:

### Some possibility of improvements
- More test scenarios such as multiple child nodes, empty nodes, invalid nodes, etc.
- Input validation
- Some code optimisation
